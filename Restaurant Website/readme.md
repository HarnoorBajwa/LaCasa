## Project description
For our project we decided to make a restaurant website. Our website is a Italian restaurant website which contain 7 different pages. It contains the main page, menu page, introducing the chef and restaurant staff page, restaurant review page, restaurant story page, restaurant operating hour and location page and the conatct us page. All the pages have different design for desktop view and mobile view. Each page contain a header and footer. The header is different for desktop view and mobile view. In desktop view, the nevigation bar will be visible on screen unlike the navigation bar for mobile view. For mobile view, user has to click on the hamburger menu in order for the navigation bar to show. When the user hover over the link on the navigation bar the link will turn grey indicating the user mouse is hovering on top of the link. When user click on the link, the user will be bring to the page that the user clicked on. For the main page, user will be able to see pictures from the restaurant and there will be links that takes user to another pages. User can click on the logo of the restaurant on the header and that will bring the user to the main page. For the menu page, user will be able to know whta the resaturant is serving. For the review page, user will be able to see the review of the past customers. However, the user will not be able to leave a review. For the our story page, user will be able to read the story of our restaurant, La Casa. For The Team page, the cooking staff and working staff will be introduce to the user. For Hours & Location page, the user can check the restaurant operating hour and the location of the restaurant. Last but not least, the user will be able to get the restaurant informating and send a webform to the restaurant on the contact us page. Other than clicking on the contact us link on the navigation bar, the user can also click on the contact us link on the footer to get to the contact us page. When user submit a webform, a window alert will pop up to notify the user the message has been sent.
